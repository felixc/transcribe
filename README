transcribe.py - Generate static HTML websites from Django templates and YAML.

Transcribe is a static site generator that integrates the conveniences of
Django to allow you to easily use templates; generate RSS feeds; and create
chronological archives, tag-link-pages, and index pages.

By using Transcribe you can run a site without any database dependencies,
without worrying about vulnerabilities in a complex stack, and with super
fast-loading plain old HTML pages, while still keeping (some of) the
conveniences you associate with a stack like Django.

Depends on Django (djangoproject.com) and PyYAML (pyyaml.org).
